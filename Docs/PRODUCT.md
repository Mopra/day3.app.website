## 1. One-liner

**Simple product update emails for small SaaS teams. No marketing suite. No contact
tax. No free tier.**

Day3 is a deliberately minimal newsletter/email tool for small software teams that
just want to send product updates and changelogs to their users — without learning,
paying for, or fighting a full marketing automation platform.

## 2. Positioning & philosophy

Day3 is opinionated and narrow on purpose. It does a few things well and refuses to
become a marketing suite.

- **For small SaaS teams**, not agencies or large marketing departments.
- **Product updates, not campaigns-in-the-marketing-sense.** Changelogs, release
  notes, "what's new" emails.
- **No contact tax.** You are not billed per subscriber. Pricing is a flat plan.
- **No free tier.** Day3 is a paid product; there is no free plan and no perpetual
  trial. (This is a hard product rule.)
- **Deliverability and compliance are built in, not add-ons:** verified sending
  domains, double opt-in, one-click unsubscribe, automatic bounce/complaint
  suppression, and account auto-pause on bad reputation.
- **Deliberately excluded:** marketing automation flows, audience segmentation,
  A/B testing, drag-and-drop template builders, open/click analytics dashboards
  beyond basic delivery stats, and a free tier. These are out of scope by design.

## 3. Who it's for

Small SaaS teams (often a single founder or a tiny team) who need a reliable,
no-nonsense way to email their existing users about product changes, and who want
signup forms to grow that list — without the complexity or cost of Mailchimp,
HubSpot, ConvertKit, etc.

## 4. Pricing & tiers

Billing runs through **Clerk Billing** (Stripe-backed) and is scoped to the
**organization** (the tenant), not individual users.

| Plan | Clerk slug | Monthly email limit | Sending | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| **None** | `none` | 0 | ❌ Disabled | Default state before subscribing, or after a subscription ends. |
| **Tiny** | `tiny` | **10,000 emails / month** | ✅ Enabled | Entry plan. **$5/mo** at launch. |
| **(mid)** | _confirm in app repo_ | **50,000 emails / month** | ✅ Enabled | **$20/mo** at launch. Featured plan on the pricing page. |
| **(top)** | _confirm in app repo_ | **200,000 emails / month** | ✅ Enabled | **$50/mo** at launch. |

> **Marketing positioning:** the public site sells **three send-based plans**
> ($5 / $20 / $50, set by monthly email volume), all with **unlimited
> subscribers** and **no per-contact tax**. Only the `tiny` slug is confirmed
> against code in this repo; the two higher tiers are positioned on the site but
> their Clerk slugs/entitlements must be confirmed against the app repo's
> `src/services/plans.ts` and kept in sync here.

Key pricing facts:

- **Plans are priced by emails sent per month, never by subscriber count.**
  Every plan includes unlimited subscribers.
- **No free tier** — the cheapest plan is $5/mo. There is no perpetual trial.
- **No usage-based overages** — sending hard-stops at the plan's monthly limit;
  to send more you move up a plan.
- **Each plan's monthly limit is a hard cap**, enforced atomically at send time so
  concurrent workers can never over-send.
- **Usage resets** at the start of each billing period (driven by the Clerk
  `subscriptionItem.active` webhook; a monthly cron sweep is the fallback).
- **No per-contact / per-subscriber pricing.** Subscriber count does not affect price.
- **Subscription lifecycle → behavior:**
  - `active` → can send.
  - `past_due` → plan still visible, but **sending is blocked** until payment is fixed.
  - `ended` → plan drops to `none`, sending disabled.
- **Risk-paused accounts never send**, regardless of plan, until an admin clears them.

> Source of truth in code: `src/services/plans.ts` (plan entitlements), Clerk
> webhook `app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`, billing UI `app/(app)/billing/page.tsx`.
> If you change pricing, plan slugs, or limits, update this table.

## 5. Core concepts (domain model)

| Concept | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| **Account** | The tenant. One per Clerk **organization**. Holds plan, usage, sending status, company mailing address, and a public `slug` for forms. |
| **Account user** | A team member (Clerk user) belonging to an account, with a role (`admin` / `member`). |
| **Audience** | A named list of subscribers. |
| **Subscriber** | A contact in an audience. Status: `subscribed`, `pending` (awaiting double opt-in), `unsubscribed`, `bounced`, `complained`, or `suppressed`. Only `subscribed` contacts receive campaigns. |
| **Sending domain** | A verified email-sending identity (e.g. `news@yourcompany.com`), set up via AWS SES with DKIM/SPF/DMARC DNS records. Campaigns require a verified domain. |
| **Campaign** | A single email send to one audience. Lifecycle: `draft` → `pending_review` → `approved` → `generating_recipients` → `sending` → `sent` (or `paused`, `blocked`, `failed`). |
| **Campaign recipient** | A per-email send record — the source of truth for idempotent, no-duplicate delivery. Tracks delivery status (`pending`, `sending`, `sent`, `delivered`, `bounced`, `complained`, `unsubscribed`, `failed`, `skipped`). |
| **Form** | A hosted/embeddable signup form that captures new subscribers into an audience. |
| **Suppression entry** | A blocklist record (per-account or global) that prevents sending to an address that unsubscribed, bounced, complained, or was manually suppressed. |
| **Import** | A CSV upload job that adds subscribers to an audience. |
| **Risk review** | An automated spam/abuse assessment of a campaign before it sends. |

## 6. Features

### 6.1 Campaigns
- Create a campaign with name, subject, preview text, from name/email, and an HTML body.
- **Rich-text WYSIWYG editor** (TipTap) constrained to an email-safe HTML allowlist —
  what you see is exactly what recipients get.
- **Merge tags:** `{{first_name}}`, `{{last_name}}`, `{{email}}`, plus an auto-appended
  unsubscribe footer and `{{company_address}}`.
- **Send a test email** to yourself before sending for real.
- **Submit & send** kicks off a review → recipient-generation → batched-send pipeline.
- **Pause / resume** an in-flight send.
- **Live delivery stats:** total recipients, sent, delivered, bounced, complained,
  unsubscribed, failed, skipped — plus a recipient-level table and an undeliverable list.
- **Risk review** runs before send; risky campaigns can be routed to admin review.

### 6.2 AI assist (optional)
AI features are **optional and gated** — if no AI key is configured, the AI UI is
hidden and the app works normally. Powered by **OpenRouter**, defaulting to
**Claude Sonnet 4.6** (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`, configurable).

- **Draft a full campaign** from a short brief + tone (friendly / professional /
  excited / casual / concise) → generates subject, preview text, and body.
- **Subject line ideas** — generates 5 alternatives.
- **Preview text** — auto-writes an inbox preview from the subject + body.
- **Select-to-rewrite** — highlight text in the editor and rewrite it (improve,
  shorten, friendlier, more professional, fix grammar).
- AI output is run through the same HTML sanitizer; merge tags are preserved.

### 6.3 Audiences & subscribers
- Create named audiences.
- **CSV import** (email, first_name, last_name; up to ~5,000 rows per file) with
  dedup, suppression filtering, progress tracking, and re-upload/retry for failed imports.
- **Add subscribers manually.**
- Search and filter subscribers by status; unsubscribe individuals.
- Subscriber-status breakdown per audience.

### 6.4 Signup forms
One form primitive, multiple install surfaces, all hosted on **`go.day3.app`**:

- **Hosted page** — a shareable link (`go.day3.app/<account>/<form>` pretty URL, or
  `go.day3.app/f/<id>` stable URL) for bios, emails, social.
- **Embed (iframe)** — drop-in snippet for website builders (Webflow, WordPress,
  Squarespace, etc.); auto-resizes via `postMessage`.
- **Popup** — JS widget (`embed.js`) triggered by button click, delay, exit-intent,
  or scroll depth.
- **Raw HTML** — a plain `<form>` that POSTs directly to Day3 (no JavaScript).

Form configuration: headline, description, button label, accent color, success
message, optional post-signup redirect, optional first-name collection, active/off
toggle, and a **double opt-in** toggle.

- **Double opt-in is ON by default** for deliverability. A pending signup is **never
  emailed a campaign** until it confirms via a signed confirmation link (token valid
  30 days). Double opt-in requires a verified sending domain (to send the confirmation).
- **GDPR:** consent IP is stored for form signups.
- Form submission is **idempotent** and **never resurrects** an opted-out/suppressed
  address.

### 6.5 Sending domains (deliverability)
- Add a domain and get the DKIM/SPF/DMARC DNS records to publish.
- **Auto-check / manual recheck** of verification status.
- Optional **Return-Path (custom MAIL FROM)** setup for better deliverability.
- **One-click DNS auto-configuration via Cloudflare OAuth** (connect a Cloudflare
  account; Day3 writes the records for you).

### 6.6 Compliance & reputation
- **One-click unsubscribe** (RFC 8058 / `List-Unsubscribe`) with HMAC-signed tokens,
  plus a public unsubscribe page.
- **Automatic suppression** of bounced/complained/unsubscribed addresses (per-account
  and global scopes).
- **Bounce/complaint handling** via SES → SNS webhooks updates recipient status and
  suppresses bad addresses; sustained bad reputation can auto-pause an account.

### 6.7 Billing & account settings
- Billing page: current plan, subscription status, monthly usage, renewal date, and
  Clerk's pricing table for upgrade/checkout.
- Settings: company mailing address (legally required in email footers) and Clerk's
  organization management (team members, org name, logo).

### 6.8 Admin (staff only)
- Platform overview: account counts, campaigns by status, recent failed/dead-letter jobs.
- Per-account drill-down: pause/resume sending, usage, bounce/complaint rates, domains, campaigns.
- **Campaign review queue:** approve & send, or block (with reason) flagged campaigns.
- Force-verify a domain; suppress addresses globally.

## 7. How it works (architecture)

Day3 is split into two cooperating tiers that share one Postgres database:

```
   Vercel (web)            Supabase Postgres            VPS Worker (BullMQ)
  ┌────────────┐          ┌────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────┐
  │ Next.js UI │  ──────► │  source of     │ ◄──────  │ queue consumer   │
  │ API routes │          │  truth (all    │          │ cron sweeps      │
  │ queue      │  ──┐     │  content + IDs)│          │ SES delivery     │
  │ producer   │    │     └────────────────┘          └──────────────────┘
  └────────────┘    │            ▲                            ▲
                    └──── Redis (BullMQ queue) ───────────────┘
```

- **Web tier (Vercel, Next.js 16 App Router):** serves the React 19 dashboard and the
  API route handlers. Enqueues jobs but runs no long-lived work or cron.
- **Worker tier (VPS, `worker/index.ts`):** the only consumer of the BullMQ queue.
  Drains the send queue and runs cron sweeps (every 15 min). Run under pm2/systemd/Docker.
- **Postgres (Supabase) is the single source of truth.** Queue messages carry IDs only,
  never content — the worker re-reads everything from Postgres.

### 7.1 The send pipeline
1. **Submit** — user submits a campaign; it's validated (eligible account, verified
   domain, audience has subscribers) and moves to `pending_review`.
2. **Review** — an automated risk check approves it (or routes it to admin review /
   blocks it).
3. **Generate recipients** — eligible (`subscribed`, non-suppressed) subscribers are
   bulk-inserted as `campaign_recipients` (chunked, dedup-safe).
4. **Batched send** — the worker atomically reserves monthly quota, claims ~25 pending
   recipients at a time (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), renders + sends each via SES, and
   re-enqueues until done.
5. **Events** — SES delivery/bounce/complaint events flow back via SNS webhooks and
   update recipient status + suppression.
6. **Sweeps** — cron recovers stuck sends, re-checks pending domains, and reconciles
   campaign completion.

### 7.2 Reliability rules (non-negotiable)
- **Idempotent jobs:** a retried message never duplicates a send. `campaign_recipients.status`
  is the source of truth; sends are claimed via atomic `UPDATE … LIMIT n`.
- **Every query is scoped by `account_id`**, resolved server-side from the Clerk org —
  client-provided account IDs are never trusted (admin routes excepted).
- **Stuck `sending` recipients are swept to `failed`, never back to `pending`** (resending
  could duplicate).
- **All email goes through the `EmailProvider` interface** — `mock` logs, `ses` sends.

## 9. Key user flows

1. **Onboarding:** sign up → create/join an organization → subscribe to the `tiny` plan
   → verify a sending domain → create an audience → create a campaign → send.
2. **Grow the list:** create a signup form → embed/share it → subscribers confirm
   (double opt-in) → they land in an audience.
3. **Send a product update:** draft (optionally with AI) → test email → submit → Day3
   reviews, generates recipients, and sends in batches → watch live delivery stats.
4. **Stay compliant:** unsubscribes, bounces, and complaints auto-suppress; bad
   reputation can auto-pause the account.
